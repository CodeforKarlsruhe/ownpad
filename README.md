# OwnPad â€” Etherpad and Ethercalc links in ownCloud

OwnPad is an ownCloud application that allows to create and open
Etherpad and Ethercalc documents. This application requires to have
access to an instance of Etherpad and/or Ethercalc to work properly.

This application works pretty much like
[`files_etherpad`](https://github.com/EELV-fr/Owncloud-Ether-Docs) but
is a complete rewrite.
